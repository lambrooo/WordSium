            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 26, 2023</p> <!-- *** MODIFICA DATA *** -->

            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how WordSurprise ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our website (the "Service"). Your privacy is important to us.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information you provide directly:</strong> If you subscribe to our newsletter, we collect your email address. If you contact us via email or a contact form, we collect your name, email address, and the content of your message.</li>
                <li><strong>Information collected automatically (Usage Data):</strong> We may automatically collect certain information when you visit our site, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, and time spent on pages. This is typically done through server logs and potentially through cookies for basic site functionality.</li>
                 <li><strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong> We use your browser's `localStorage` to save your preferences (like light/dark theme choice), your visit streak, and your saved word collection. This data resides solely on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide, operate, and maintain our Service.</li>
                <li>To improve, personalize, and expand our Service.</li>
                <li>To understand and analyze how you use our Service.</li>
                <li>To communicate with you, either directly or through one of our partners, including for customer service, to provide you with updates and other information relating to the Service, and for marketing and promotional purposes (like the newsletter, if you opt-in).</li>
                <li>To send you emails (newsletter if subscribed).</li>
                <li>To find and prevent fraud.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.</p>
            <p>We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.</p>
            <p>Data stored in your browser's `localStorage` (theme, streak, collection) remains until you clear your browser data.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

             <h2>Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
             <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>The right to access – You have the right to request copies of your personal data.</li>
                <li>The right to rectification – You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete.</li>
                <li>The right to erasure – You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
                <li>The right to restrict processing – You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
                <li>The right to object to processing – You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
                <li>The right to data portability – You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
            </ul>
             <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at our provided email.</p>


            <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
             <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
            <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
